# Unlockdb Unlocker
Takes the unlockdb.xml from the `data\ui` directory of Halo MCC and unlocks everything, even the unlisted items.
> The game version shouldn't matter unless 343 does some classic tomfoolery and breaks everything.

## Usage
- Locate the unlockdb.xml file; 
    - Steam location: `steamapps\common\Halo The Master Chief Collection\Data\ui`
    - Microsoft Store location: `XboxGames\Halo- The Master Chief Collection\Content\data\ui`
- Open a command prompt and write the following command: `.\unlockdb path/to/your/xml/unlockdb.xml`
- Launch Halo MCC with Easy Anti-Cheat disabled.
- If you want to revert the changes, delete the file, verify the integrity of the game files, and launch with Easy Anti-Cheat enabled. Your file should be corrected.
